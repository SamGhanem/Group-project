Proposal:

Language used: MERN 
Ellie: backend
Sam: frontend
Chris: styling 

Our group project proposal is to create a travel application. The purpose is to record multiple trips including pictures. Our inspiration is because we all travel for work and tourism and we thought this would be useful as all of the trip details and pictures will be in a digital scrap book. On the main page we have a table that displays all the trips from this page the user can click details, edit or delete. From the main page the user can also add a new trip. The add page will include a title, place and about section as well as a place to upload pictures. From the edit page, the user can edit all 4 categories! Clicking the details button will take the user to a page that displays that tripâ€™s title, about and pictures they have uploaded. This includes all CRUD functionality and we hope that users will be able to look back on their digital scrapbook!
